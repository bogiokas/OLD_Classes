Compiling through
$g++ ./produce_lp.cpp
throughs a warning about a bad designed non-void function which could theoretically not return a result. One can safely ignore it.

This program expects in stdin the following input:
an integer n, denoting the number of stations of the network
an integer L, denoting the number of unoriented Lines of the network
for each l in 1,...,L:
	an integer num_s, denoting the number of stations of line l
	a sequence of num_s integers (each one of them in {1,...,n}), denoting the sequence of the stations that the line l visits - in the right order. This order is going to be symbolized with ')' in the output and the reversed with '('.
	a sequence of num_s-1 integers, denoting the driving time between the stations of line l, in the same order.
an inteeger T, denoting the period
two integers wl and wu, denoting the possible lengths of the waiting activities of every station.
two integers tl and tu, with tu-tl=T-1, denoting the possible lengths of the travel activities of every station.
The input for the particular problem is in the file "./network.in".

The program returns (hopefully) in stdout the cycle-and-slack MIP formulation of the input PESP instance in SCIP readable form.
The output for the particular problem is in the file "./network.lp".
