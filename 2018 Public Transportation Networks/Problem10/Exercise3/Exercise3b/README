The code in 3b.cpp returns in stout an lp program.
The file 3b.lp has already this output.
The file 3b.sol is the solution produced by SCIP on the input of 3b.lp

The file 3b.sh compiles 3b.cpp, runs it and redirects its output to 3b.lp and then uses SCIP to optimize the MIP and write the solution in 3b.sol
